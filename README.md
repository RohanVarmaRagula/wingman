# Wingman

Meet **Wingman** ‚Äî the AI that assists, not insists. Wingman is your sidekick that debugs, explains, and tests‚Ä¶ only when summoned.  
Forget copy-pasting into ChatGPT or losing focus jumping between tabs. Wingman lives in your editor, ready to break down errors, suggest smart fixes, or whip up test cases ‚Äî without taking the wheel.  

Because real devs don‚Äôt want AI writing their code ‚Äî they want AI helping them write better code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

Wingman supports **multiple LLM providers**. You can choose the one that works best for you:

### 1. Select Your LLM Provider  
For now we only have **Google**. Will bring others and **Ollama** in future versions.

### 2. Choose the Model  
Pick your preferred model like `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`, etc. Wingman lets you switch models anytime based on your needs and budget.

### 3. Set Your API Key  
On first run (or when using a new provider), Wingman will prompt you to enter your API key.  
These keys are stored securely using VS Code‚Äôs Secrets API.

You can set/change them from the command palette:  
**`Wingman: Set API Key`**

### 4. Reset All Secrets  
Want a fresh start? Use the command:  
**`Wingman: Reset Secrets`**  
This will clear all stored keys and provider/model settings.
